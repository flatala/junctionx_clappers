Flag only spans that ADVOCATE or SUPPORT extremist harm or unlawful violence.

DEFINITIONS
- Extremist span: advocacy, praise, threat, recruitment, or instruction related to violence or unlawful harm; or hate speech targeting protected classes (race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc.).

- Output JSON only. No explanations outside the schema. No chain-of-thought.
